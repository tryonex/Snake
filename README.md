# Snake

This is a very simple Snake Game that i wrote in 30 minutes some time ago. You wont die when you hit yourself, but you will get faster every time you eat the red dot, making it more difficult by time. Control the Snake with WASD-keys.

Prerequisites: Java 6+ JRE and JDK installed. [(Oracle downloads)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html). Make sure that everything is working and your environment variables are set up by typing ```javac -version``` and ```java -version``` into console. 

To download, compile and start the program do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/tryonex/Snake.git
cd Snake
cd src
javac -cp . ./Frame.java
java Frame
```
